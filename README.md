# Decentralized Quiz App

## Project Title
**Decentralized Quiz App - On-Chain Quiz Platform with Automated Rewards**

## Project Description
The Decentralized Quiz App is a blockchain-based quiz platform built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. This innovative application allows users to participate in quizzes where their scores are permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. The platform features an automated reward distribution system that incentivizes participation and rewards high performers based on their quiz performance.

The smart contract handles score submission, participant tracking, reward distribution, and maintains comprehensive statistics about quiz participation. All data is stored on-chain, providing a trustless and verifiable system for educational assessments and competitive quizzing.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the online learning and assessment ecosystem by creating a transparent, fair, and rewarding quiz platform that leverages blockchain technology. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Cheating**: By recording scores on an immutable blockchain, we ensure data integrity and prevent score manipulation
- **Automate Rewards**: Smart contracts automatically distribute rewards based on predefined criteria, removing intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation
- **Create Trust**: Participants can verify their scores and reward distributions transparently on the blockchain
- **Incentivize Learning**: By providing on-chain rewards, we motivate users to engage more deeply with educational content
- **Build a Decentralized Education Ecosystem**: Enable educators, institutions, and content creators to host verifiable assessments without centralized control

## Key Features

### 1. **On-Chain Score Recording**
- Participants can submit their quiz scores directly to the blockchain
- Each score submission includes participant address, quiz ID, score, and timestamp
- All submissions are permanently recorded and verifiable

### 2. **Automated Reward Distribution**
- Smart contract-based reward system that distributes tokens automatically
- Rewards can be distributed to participants based on their performance
- Prevents double-rewarding with built-in reward status tracking

### 3. **Participant Tracking**
- Individual participant records stored with complete quiz history
- View scores by participant address and quiz ID
- Track reward status for each participant

### 4. **Comprehensive Statistics**
- Real-time tracking of total participants across all quizzes
- Monitor total rewards distributed by the platform
- Track the highest score achieved to identify top performers

### 5. **Secure Authentication**
- Built-in address verification ensures only authorized participants can submit scores
- Prevents unauthorized score submissions and manipulation

### 6. **Persistent Storage**
- Extended Time-To-Live (TTL) settings ensure data persistence
- Quiz records and statistics remain accessible for long-term verification

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Multiple Quiz Categories**: Support for different quiz types (educational, trivia, skill assessment)
- **Dynamic Reward Calculation**: Implement algorithms to calculate rewards based on score percentiles and difficulty levels
- **Leaderboard System**: On-chain leaderboards to showcase top performers across different time periods
- **Time-bound Quizzes**: Add quiz expiration and time limit features

### Medium-term Goals
- **NFT Certificates**: Issue NFT-based certificates for quiz completion and achievement milestones
- **Staking Mechanism**: Allow participants to stake tokens to participate in premium quizzes
- **Multi-signature Admin Controls**: Implement multi-sig for quiz creation and reward pool management
- **Quiz Creator Marketplace**: Enable educators to create and monetize their own quizzes
- **Answer Verification**: Integrate decentralized oracle solutions for automated answer verification

### Long-term Vision
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Expand to other blockchain networks for wider accessibility
- **AI Integration**: Implement AI-powered question generation and difficulty adjustment
- **Decentralized Governance**: DAO structure for platform decisions and reward pool allocation
- **Integration with Educational Institutions**: Partner with schools and universities for certified assessments
- **Mobile dApp**: Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- **Social Features**: Add peer-to-peer challenges, study groups, and collaborative learning features
- **Token Economics**: Launch platform-native token with utility and governance features
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics for participants to track learning progress and performance trends
